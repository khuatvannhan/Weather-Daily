# CustomPlaceAutocomplete
This is a custom auto complete for android. The reason you might need a custom implementation for places autocomplte is that the default autocomplete for places is not customisable because of a bug (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=5237). 

Also, if you need to use play services version less than 7.0 then autocomplete is not available. But, this code is compatible with any version of play service.
